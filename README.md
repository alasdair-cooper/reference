> This repo is just project templates at the moment, nothing useful has been added yet!

This is a project I am using to store various tricks, best practices and larger problem solutions that I find recurrently useful.

This consists of an Aspire app hosting an ASP.NET API backend for a Blazor WASM standalone frontend and a Rust ([Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)) frontend.
